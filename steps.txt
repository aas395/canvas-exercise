Canvas is a powerful way to create images, animations, and games dynamically using only Javascript. It fills an important gap in HTML's feature set -- you can create real circles and other shapes without having to use CSS workarounds.

Here we are going to recreate the GA logo using canvas. I have added all the necessary files for you to complete the exercise, so all you need to do is write the canvas code.

Here are the steps you will need to take:

1) Set canvas height and width and remove background color
2) Draw a black circle (100,100,50,0, 1.5*Math.PI)
3) Draw a red circle (#FA4542)
4) Add GA text
5) Refactor code to create functions for adding circles (include context in args) and text
6) Animate circle
